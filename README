-------------

We have merged changes from : github.com/lukeroth/gdal in https://github.com/nearmap/gdal/pull/4.
These changes require GDAL 3.6+ now.
While not documented cleary in the source repository, it is mentioned in a [comment](https://github.com/lukeroth/gdal/blob/d4ff2229365e0206000207bc101f72b0ab2b2310/algorithms.go#L364):
> // SizeOfStructure: Added in GDAL 3.6 to detect potential ABI issues. Should be set to sizeof(GDALGridLinearOptions)

Note: GDAL is available in debian bookworm , but not in bullseye and older versions.
